# Code for session 2 of the Intro to LLMs reading group

A simple transformer for sentiment analysis is coded.

The code is written Python. A conda environment contains all necessary dependencies. It can be installed using

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

And activated through 

`conda activate torch_env`

This code has been adapted from [https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers). Thanks for open-sourcing!
